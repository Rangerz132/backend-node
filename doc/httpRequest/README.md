# ðŸ“¬ HTTP Request Overview

An HTTP request is the message sent by a client (like a browser or app) to a server to ask for a resource or perform an action. It consists mainly of:

---

## 1. Request Line

The first line indicates the HTTP method and the URL path:
Common HTTP methods:

- `GET`: Retrieve data (usually no body)
- `POST`: Create data (usually with a body)
- `PUT`: Replace a resource entirely
- `PATCH`: Update part of a resource
- `DELETE`: Remove a resource

---

## 2. Headers

Headers provide metadata about the request or client. They are key-value pairs sent after the request line.

Common headers include:

- **Host**: The domain of the server (required in HTTP/1.1).
- **Content-Type**: Specifies the media type (format) of the request body.  
  Examples:
  - `application/json` (JSON data)
  - `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (form data)
  - `multipart/form-data` (file uploads)
- **Authorization**: Carries credentials for authentication.
  - **Basic**: Base64-encoded username and password.  
    Example: `Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz`
  - **Bearer**: Token-based authentication, commonly JWT tokens.  
    Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
- **Accept**: Indicates which response formats the client can handle.
- **Content-Length**: Size of the request body in bytes (auto-calculated by clients).

---

## 3. Body (Payload)

The body contains data sent to the server, mostly with methods like `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`.

- Its format is specified by the `Content-Type` header.
- Common body formats:
  - **JSON** (`application/json`): Most popular for APIs.
  - **Form URL-encoded** (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`): Key-value pairs like form data.
  - **Multipart/form-data**: For file uploads and mixed content.

---

## 4. Authentication Schemes

### Basic Authentication

- Uses Base64 encoding of `username:password`.
- Less secure unless over HTTPS.
- Example header: Authorization: Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz

### Bearer Authentication

- Uses tokens, typically JWTs.
- More secure and flexible.
- Example header: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
